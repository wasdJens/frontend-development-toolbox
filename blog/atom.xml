        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction to the website]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A small background on why this site exists and what it is for.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why">Why?<a href="#why" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why?" title="Direct link to Why?">â€‹</a></h2><p>Over the past years I have learned a lot in terms of creating digital products and the software engineering process. Many of these topics came from public blog posts and articles. During the transition from twitter to X I have learned a valuable lesson: social media platforms can take all of your content with a click of a button and any content is simply gone. This is why I have decided to create this website and write about my experiences and learnings. Because here I have full control about the content and can also decide what to post. </p><p>My goal is to simply have a place where I can write all my thoughts, ideas and more down instead of having everything part of my personal <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">obsidian vault</a>. Also a lot of my colleagues often asked me about certain topics so here I can easily share them with the world. I also want to give something back for free because most of my knowledge came from ressource that anyone on the internet can read and learn from. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-you-will-find-here">What you will find here<a href="#what-you-will-find-here" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What you will find here" title="Direct link to What you will find here">â€‹</a></h2><p>Basically anything that I think is important when it comes to creating software and speciallly software that is tailored for the world wide web. The website itself is built with <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docusaurus</a> and split into the following sections:</p><ul><li>Software Engineering</li><li>Architecture</li><li>Learning</li><li>Blog</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="software-engineering">Software Engineering<a href="#software-engineering" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Software Engineering" title="Direct link to Software Engineering">â€‹</a></h3><p>Is built as documentation and reference for all things related to any software engineering process. This includes thoughts what even software engineering is and how to approach it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="architecture">Architecture<a href="#architecture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Architecture" title="Direct link to Architecture">â€‹</a></h3><p>Here I want to document how you can build systems based on a given technology or framework. I try to follow the <a href="https://diataxis.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diÃ taxis</a> approach here and at the moment you will find a lot about <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">angular</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="learning">Learning<a href="#learning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Learning" title="Direct link to Learning">â€‹</a></h3><p>In the last two years I have teached at the Duale Hochschule Baden WÃ¼rttemberg as lecturer for Web Programming. Many of these ressources were originally created as powerpoint and shared over multiple channels. Since I use the same slides for internal teachings at PlanB. GmbH I wanted to have a place where I can easily share them by providing a single link. Also I hate working with powerpoint and markdown allows me to easier write. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blog">Blog<a href="#blog" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blog" title="Direct link to Blog">â€‹</a></h3><p>The blog is my place where I will randomly write about anything. I try to keep it software related but I can't promise anything ðŸ˜…. This is also the entry point to maybe special topics that are then part of one of the other sections in much more detail.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-leave-feedback">How to leave feedback<a href="#how-to-leave-feedback" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to leave feedback" title="Direct link to How to leave feedback">â€‹</a></h2><p>I love to hear from you and also get ideas where I could improve certain topics. At the moment the best way is to write me an Email (<a href="mailto:jens.reiner@plan-b-gmbh.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jens.reiner@plan-b-gmbh.com</a>) in the future I am looking to integrate <a href="https://github.com/giscus/giscus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giscus)</a> to allow you to leave comments directly on the website.</p>]]></content>
