A small background on why this site exists and what it is for.

<!--truncate-->

## Why?

Over the past years I have learned a lot in terms of creating digital products and the software engineering process. Many of these topics came from public blog posts and articles. During the transition from twitter to X I have learned a valuable lesson: social media platforms can take all of your content with a click of a button and any content is simply gone. This is why I have decided to create this website and write about my experiences and learnings. Because here I have full control about the content and can also decide what to post. 

My goal is to simply have a place where I can write all my thoughts, ideas and more down instead of having everything part of my personal [obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/). Also a lot of my colleagues often asked me about certain topics so here I can easily share them with the world. I also want to give something back for free because most of my knowledge came from ressource that anyone on the internet can read and learn from. 

## What you will find here

Basically anything that I think is important when it comes to creating software and speciallly software that is tailored for the world wide web. The website itself is built with [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and split into the following sections:

- Software Engineering
- Architecture
- Learning
- Blog

### Software Engineering

Is built as documentation and reference for all things related to any software engineering process. This includes thoughts what even software engineering is and how to approach it.

### Architecture

Here I want to document how you can build systems based on a given technology or framework. I try to follow the [diÃ taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) approach here and at the moment you will find a lot about [angular](https://angular.io/).

### Learning

In the last two years I have teached at the Duale Hochschule Baden WÃ¼rttemberg as lecturer for Web Programming. Many of these ressources were originally created as powerpoint and shared over multiple channels. Since I use the same slides for internal teachings at PlanB. GmbH I wanted to have a place where I can easily share them by providing a single link. Also I hate working with powerpoint and markdown allows me to easier write. 

### Blog

The blog is my place where I will randomly write about anything. I try to keep it software related but I can't promise anything ðŸ˜…. This is also the entry point to maybe special topics that are then part of one of the other sections in much more detail.

## How to leave feedback

I love to hear from you and also get ideas where I could improve certain topics. At the moment the best way is to write me an Email (jens.reiner@plan-b-gmbh.com) in the future I am looking to integrate [giscus)](https://github.com/giscus/giscus) to allow you to leave comments directly on the website.
