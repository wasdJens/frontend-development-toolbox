Some updates about recent progress and finally getting the motivation to start working on this website.

<!--truncate-->

## New Motivation

In the last weeks I have consumed a lot of content and also started reading the book `The Software Engineers Guidebook` (ISBN-10: 908338182X) by `Gergely Orosz` and since then I had so many ideas on how to structure this website and finally getting started working on all the topics I either have written down as notes in my personal obsidian vault or which are floating in my head ðŸ˜…. 

I also finished my lecture about "Web Programmierung" for this year and have created complete new slides which I want to post here as well under the learning section. 

As you may have noticed I have also renamed the main navigation items of this website to better reflect what I want to achieve. 

## Goal for End of 2024

By the end of the current year I want to have certain topics finished for the toolbox section (Mainly the requirements engineering and product definition part) and also migrated the lecture slides to markdown content. For the next year I then want to start writing the new angular handbook and release this website to the public (With hopefully my own domain and stuff like that)
