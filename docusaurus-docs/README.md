# Docusaurus Docs
This folder includes the source code for building the static site which is hosted at github. It uses [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/) under the hook to create a modern static website generator.

## Development
For development purposes you can run the project using the following commands:

> Installation
```
npm i
```

> Local Development
```
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build & Deployment

The site gets automatically build on every pull request which targets the master branch. Once merged the website will get deployed.
