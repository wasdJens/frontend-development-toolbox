# Learning

In this part of the project you will find everything about my teaching that I am doing. It also includes part of my lecture "Web Programmierung" which I teach at the Duale Hochschule BadenwÃ¼rttemberg in Heidenheim. You can use these ressources to get familiar with certain topics and I am using it to provide an easy access to all of my "slides" and stuff.

## What you will find here

### JavaScript [ðŸš§]
A basic introduction to JavaScript and how to use it. Aimed at beginner levels if you have never touched a programming language before.

### NodeJS [ðŸš§]
A quick look at a JavaScript runtime environment that can be used outside of the browser to create high quality products with frameworks like ExpressJS and so on. Here we also take a look at the basics of packages in the JavaScript ecosystem.

### Basics of HTTP [ðŸš§]
One of the most important protocols for the communication between client and servers. A quick introduction to the basics of HTTP can be learned here.

### API Design [ðŸš§]
In the modern world of software products you will most likely encounter some kind of API. In this chapter we take a look at web apis and how to design them. It also includes an introduction to REST and why most modern "REST" APIs are not RESTful.

### Angular [ðŸš§]
Everything I have learned in over three years of using angular to create amazing products on the web. A complete guide for the framework which you can use as a reference on how to build enterprise level angular applications. Many things are taken from the official angular documentation but enhanced with certain topics that guide you in creating large scale applications.
