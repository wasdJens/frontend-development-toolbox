# Learning

In this part of the toolbox you will find resources related to learning. I write "handbooks" for all kinds of topics (Mainly covering web technologies). Here you will find copies of these and also the links to the original github repos.

## What you will find here

### Dont Panic - Web Edition
This is a handbook to introduce the basics of modern web development focused on JavaScript and the basics of client server architecures. See https://github.com/wasdJens/dont-panic-web-edition.

### API Design [ðŸš§]
In the modern world of software products you will most likely encounter some kind of API. In this chapter I like to collect philosophies and best practices for designing APIs.

### Angular [ðŸš§]
Everything I have learned in over three years of using angular to create amazing products on the web. A complete guide for the framework which you can use as a reference on how to build enterprise level angular applications. Many things are taken from the official angular documentation but enhanced with certain topics that guide you in creating large scale applications.
