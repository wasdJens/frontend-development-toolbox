# Introduction
This chapter provides a background why we think software engineering is important. It takes into account definitions found in software engineering lectures and from our personal experience.

The main takeaway from this chapter is that modern product development is often easier, faster and cheaper when certain software engineering techniques are used. You dont start building a house by laying a random brick on the ground. You often start with a plan, a foundation and use certain building techniques to achieve your goal.

## What is Software Engineering?
What is our understanding of Software Engineering?

**Engineering discipline** 
Engineers make things work. They apply theories, methods, and tools where these are appropriate. However, they use them selectively and always try to discover solutions to problems even when there are no applicable theories and methods. Engineers also recognize that they must work within organizational and financial constraints, and they must look for solutions within these constraints. <cite>[1]</cite>

**All aspects of software production**
Software engineering is not just concerned with the technical processes of software development. It also includes activities such as software project management and the development of tools, methods, and theories to support software development. <cite>[1]</cite>

## Why Software Engineering?
Why you should use software engineering - Explained in two key aspects and some personal opinions.

1. More and more, individuals and society rely on advanced software systems. We need to be able to produce reliable and thrustworthy systems economically and quickly. <cite>[1]</cite>

2. It is usually cheaper, in the long run, to use software engineering methods and techniques for professional software systems rather than just write programs as personal programming project. Failure to use software engineering method leads to higher costs for testing, quality assurance, and long-term maintenance. <cite>[1]</cite>

**Software is hard.** Not from a technical perspective but from a product vision that you want to deliver. There are thousands of tools, methods and principles that you can choose from. There is no right or wrong way - We often learn from our experience what we want to improve or change in the future.
