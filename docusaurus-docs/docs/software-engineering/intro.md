# Introduction

Hi and welcome to my personal collection of software engineering knowledge which I call `Toolbox` and is inspired by traditonal craftsmanships where you have a toolbox with all the tools you need to create something amazing.

Beside my personal blog and my learning ressources this is the heart of my website. You can use it as a ressource for your own journey in creating amazing digital products or simply as another source of information.

I try to follow a red line through all of the topics so you can learn step by step or dive deeper into topics that you are interested in. Most of the topics I cover here I have either learned in the last years through my work or by reading other "blogs" and articles on the web as well as books. You will often find credits at the bottom of each page where I link to the original source.

## Feedback
If you have any feedback or want to discuss certain topics feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:wasdJens@gmail.com)
