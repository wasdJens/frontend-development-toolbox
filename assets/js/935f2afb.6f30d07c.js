Along the way you will learn how you can setup a project where you can develop multiple angular applications and libraries based on the same project structure. It allows you to manage your angular library and applications from a single source.","sidebar":"architectureSidebar"},"architecture/intro":{"id":"architecture/intro","title":"Architecture","description":"","sidebar":"architectureSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Toolbox Introduction","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"software-engineering/coding-conventions":{"id":"software-engineering/coding-conventions","title":"Coding Conventions","description":"In this chapter we want to take a closer look at coding conventions and why such rules are useful when working on software projects. Most modern software projects include multiple people who work on the codebase. Coding conventions help us in skipping discussions about coding styles and the overall goal is to reduce the maintance effort.","sidebar":"seSidebar"},"software-engineering/intro":{"id":"software-engineering/intro","title":"Introduction","description":"This chapter provides a background why we think software engineering is important.
