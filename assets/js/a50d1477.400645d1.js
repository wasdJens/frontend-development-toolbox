For the next year I then want to start writing the new angular handbook and release this website to the public (With hopefully my own domain and stuff like that)"},{"id":"/2023/10/16/Hello-World","metadata":{"permalink":"/software-engineering-toolbox/blog/2023/10/16/Hello-World","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-16-Hello-World.md","title":"Hello World \ud83d\udc4b","description":"Introduction to the website","date":"2023-10-16T16:35:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 16, 2023","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/software-engineering-toolbox/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"background","permalink":"/software-engineering-toolbox/blog/tags/background"}],"readingTime":2.47,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Reiner","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jens-reiner/","email":"wasdJens@gmail.com","key":"jreiner"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Hello World \ud83d\udc4b","description":"Introduction to the website","authors":"jreiner","tags":["hello","background"],"date":"2023-10-16T16:35"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Getting Started \ud83d\udd28","permalink":"/software-engineering-toolbox/blog/2023/11/27/Getting-Started"}},"content":"A small background on why this site exists and what it is for.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Why?\\n\\nOver the past years I have learned a lot in terms of creating digital products and the software engineering process. Many of these topics came from public blog posts and articles. During the transition from twitter to X I have learned a valuable lesson: social media platforms can take all of your content with a click of a button and any content is simply gone. This is why I have decided to create this website and write about my experiences and learnings. Because here I have full control about the content and can also decide what to post. \\n\\nMy goal is to simply have a place where I can write all my thoughts, ideas and more down instead of having everything part of my personal [obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/). Also a lot of my colleagues often asked me about certain topics so here I can easily share them with the world. I also want to give something back for free because most of my knowledge came from ressource that anyone on the internet can read and learn from. \\n\\n## What you will find here\\n\\nBasically anything that I think is important when it comes to creating software and speciallly software that is tailored for the world wide web. The website itself is built with [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and split into the following sections:\\n\\n- Software Engineering\\n- Architecture\\n- Learning\\n- Blog\\n\\n### Software Engineering\\n\\nIs built as documentation and reference for all things related to any software engineering process. This includes thoughts what even software engineering is and how to approach it.\\n\\n### Architecture\\n\\nHere I want to document how you can build systems based on a given technology or framework. I try to follow the [di\xe0taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) approach here and at the moment you will find a lot about [angular](https://angular.io/).\\n\\n### Learning\\n\\nIn the last two years I have teached at the Duale Hochschule Baden W\xfcrttemberg as lecturer for Web Programming. Many of these ressources were originally created as powerpoint and shared over multiple channels. Since I use the same slides for internal teachings at PlanB. GmbH I wanted to have a place where I can easily share them by providing a single link. Also I hate working with powerpoint and markdown allows me to easier write. \\n\\n### Blog\\n\\nThe blog is my place where I will randomly write about anything. I try to keep it software related but I can\'t promise anything \ud83d\ude05. This is also the entry point to maybe special topics that are then part of one of the other sections in much more detail.\\n\\n## How to leave feedback\\n\\nI love to hear from you and also get ideas where I could improve certain topics. At the moment the best way is to write me an Email (jens.reiner@plan-b-gmbh.com) in the future I am looking to integrate [giscus)](https://github.com/giscus/giscus) to allow you to leave comments directly on the website."}]}')}}]);
